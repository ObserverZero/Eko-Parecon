Eko - A participatory economic application for volunteering and syndicalist communities.

Eko is a front end for the Matrix specification server using the Quasar framework for Vue.

The idea is simple. Users can create and join groups. Groups can also join other groups.
The syndicalist community is thus formed through the connecting of groups into larger groups,
sharing a single community of work and exchange.
